ðŸ‘‹ hello. I am Seongmin Heo, a developer who dreams of becoming an ML engineer.   
I mainly use Python, and I deal with C/C++, SQL, etc.   
I am interested in Data Analytics, ML Engineer, and MLOps.   


I completed an AI developer training course for 6 months from December 2021, and developed a multi-speaker fairy tale reading service, "Meozzini".   
Project Wiki: https://github.com/long-practice/KDT_B1/wiki   

In service development, I was mainly responsible for data collection, pre-processing and analysis, model operation environment configuration, and database and model linkage.   

I am currently working as a text analyst and NLP, NLU engineer at Insizer Co., Ltd. since July 2022.
